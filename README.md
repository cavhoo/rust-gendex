# Rust-Gendex

This project was a start to get into some rust development.

It is a re-implementation of a really awesome Visual Studio Code extension:
[Generate Index](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JayFong.generate-index)
Created by [Jay Fong](https://github.com/fjc0k)


## Purpose

The purpose of this rust library is to be able to generate index based exports inside of typescript.
The addon that used in VSC is much more powerful, and this was simply a learning project for me.

It's not intented for use, although it works for typescript. But it's far from polished and publish ready.


## Future

I would love to bring this library to the state where it can be installed via cargo, but for that I still
have to learn so much more abour rust. And it's working. It was just the first step.
